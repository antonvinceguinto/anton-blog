A template for fresh starting out a fresh project. Plugins: NextJS, Typescript, Airbnb Eslint TS, Prettier, Husky, TailwindCSS

## Getting Started

Nothing fancy, just install the needed libraries after cloning the repo:

```bash
npm i
```

## What's inside the template?

- **NextJS** - to have an optimized out-of-the-box website
- **Typescript** - preferred over JS. This reduces bugs that may occur on production
- **Airbnb ESLint** - to apply code styling of airbnb & consistency
- **Prettier** - for code consistency
- **Husky** - for pre-commit hooks
- **TailwindCSS** - preferred styling
